# MY-VIT
I worked on server and backend for the website.  Firebase database used for user validation.

Our project focuses on both the students studying in our university and people seeking the information related to the university.

We are planning to make a fully functioning general information website.
We will also be building an easy to use android app along with it.

The general information will be available openly to everyone whereas for some particular information the students need to login using their username and password.

The students would also be provided with a login portal for personal diary.

A forum, “Chatbox” has been fashioned for the users too.

Initially the website and the app contain limited data but it can be extended further by adding more information and the number of users.
